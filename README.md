# TedBot
The primary code for the search engine is under ted_bot.py This program uses NLP techniques and cosine similarity on Ted Talk transcripts in order to find most relevant matches. The commented code can be found under newdc5.py. The data was too large to upload to github, so a google drive link is found here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/16h2m5kxYHPyBL-RQOgRMHiGI7yTOiASs/view?usp=sharing

Everything else in the repository allows one to deploy this program as chatbot over Slack using the Slack API. I am currently working on deploying it over Heroku for others to use, but there are issues between Heroku and the Sci-Kit learn Python package, so a workaround is needed.
