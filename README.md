# TedBot
This program uses NLP techniques and cosine similarity on Ted Talk transcripts in order to find most relevant matches. The commented code can be found under newdc5.py. The data was too large to upload to github, so a google drive link is found here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/16h2m5kxYHPyBL-RQOgRMHiGI7yTOiASs/view?usp=sharing

This can be deployed as a Slack Chatbot over through the Slack API on a local machine. I am currently working on deploying it over Heroku for others to use, but there are issues between Heroku and the Sci-Kit learn Python package, so a workaround is needed.
